			<p>As a child, Engineering and Software Development were a constant conversation in my household. Both my mother and father worked </p>
			<p>in IT; my father started school when I was young. My love for coding started very young when my father began to teach me as a method </p> 
			<p>for learning himself. I eventually also gained a love for animals, and when it came time to choose a path for college, I went into </p>
			<p>the Veterinary Industry. As an older adult now, I realized you don't have to choose between the things you love, and so the course to </p>
			<p>becoming a Software Developer began.</p>
