      <h4 class="border-top">About Narea</h4>
        <p>As a child, Engineering and Software Development were a constant conversation in my household. Both my mother and father worked in IT; my father started school when I was young. My love for coding started very young when my father began to teach me as a method for learning himself. I eventually also gained a love for animals, and when it came time to choose a path for college, I went into the Veterinary Industry. As an older adult now, I realized you don't have to choose between the things you love, and so the course to becoming a Software Developer began.</p>

        <p>As a student at <a 
          href="http://www.thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>, I've begun my journey to becoming a software developer and couldn't be happier! Thank you for joining me on this journey.</p>

        <p>If you're looking to hire a new developer please feel more than welcome to reach out. Alone we can be great, but as they say, two minds are greater than one!</p>
